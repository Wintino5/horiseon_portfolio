# Horiseon Website

## Description

In this project we replaced the <div> elements with the correct HTML sematic tags. We also edited the CSS stylesheet to match the changes made in the HTML file to ensure that the styles would be applied. Alt descriptions were also added to all images for accesibility. This project allowed us to learn more about HTML sematic elements and how they are use when creating a website.
